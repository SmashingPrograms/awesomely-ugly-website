* Sadly, the `<blink>` tag has been removed from html, re-implement it with CSS animations!
* Scrolling marques really help grab the attention of would-be-customers, so add one to your site

## Caffeinated Mode

* Create a web page layout that has two columns of content that are side-by-side
* Add a table of made up statistic calculations to your site (Like "# of Happy Vegetable Eaters by State")
